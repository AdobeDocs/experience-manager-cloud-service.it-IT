# Conoscere le risorse Adobe Experience Manager come interfaccia utente per i servizi cloud {#assets-cloud-service-ui}

<!--
TBD: Removing this article for now from TOC.
Need to rewrite this getting started content post-GA.

Topics to be covered:
* Overview of the home page experience.
* Parts of the UI that lead to different capabilities accessible from here.
* How to reach Assets specific UI and where to look to do DAM specific tasks.
* How to navigate, where to search, find workflows, do configurations, check reports, etc.
* How to find support and docs links, profile info, etc.
* Embed videos from Tech Mktg, if any.
* Look for videos on YT and blog posts on the Internet for introductions to AEMaaCS Assets.
